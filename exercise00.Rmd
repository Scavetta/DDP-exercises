## First Interactive Documents

Inside the following chunk:

1. Add an `inputPanel()` function to produce a radio button console. It should have two options: *Hollow* or *Filled* circles, taking the values 16 and 1 respectively.
2. Next, wrap the plotting functions in a `renderPlot({})` function.
3. Call the internal `input` object, which will be produced by the inputPanel() function, to set the appropriate argument in the plot.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) +
  geom_point(col = "red", alpha = 0.5, size = 3, shape = 19)
```
